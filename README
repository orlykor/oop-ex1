=============================

basically i designed the program according to the given API of each class, 
when needed, i added a few methods of my own to help me reach what i wanted.

=============================

according to the API. in addition the implement of each class is to maintain 
a connection between each class. at the end, each class depended on the other.

my implementation on the smart player- 
the main goal of the smart player as i implemented it was to take one stick 
when the board has an even amount of sticks, and to take two sticks when the
board has odd amount of sticks. that way the board always has odd amount of 
sticks, that way in the end the smart player get to take the last one. 

Just wanted to say, that because you said not to touch the board class i didn't
fix the magic numbers out there. don't know if you also meant that, so i 
preferred not to touch it.
